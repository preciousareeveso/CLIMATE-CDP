##**Background**
Overview:  Climate change hazards and adaptation action across CDP disclosing cities and regions in 2021
The Climate Disclosure Project (CDP) is an international non-profit organization that manages a global disclosure system for cities and corporations to disclose their environmental impacts. Comprehensive environmental data and insight which may not be readily available are utilized by policy makers to design and evaluate policies for climate action. The goal of this project is to provide insight on the participation of nations and cities in the climate disclosure identifying top climate hazards faced by cities and adaptation actions taken by CDP-disclosing cities and regions in 2021. This project is an exploratory data analysis utilizing Python libraries like Pandas (for Data Cleaning/Manipulation), MatPlotlib (for Data Exploration), plotly (for  Data Visualisation) and Tableau Story.
